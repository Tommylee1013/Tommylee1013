## 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas

Undergraduate researcher at **Sogang University (Seoul, Korea)**  
Majors in **Financial Economics, Econometrics, Big Data Science**  
Minor in **AI & Convergence Software Programming**

I focus on **quantitative finance, causal inference in asset allocation, and financial machine learning**.  
My recent work centers on building **explainable, causality-aware portfolio construction pipelines** and **robust backtesting frameworks**.

## 🔬 Recent Research & Key Projects

### Causal Asset Allocation  
**Causal Inference-Based Portfolio Optimization Pipeline**  
- Role: Leader / Researcher / Engineer  
- Summary:  
  A portfolio construction framework that explicitly models **causal relationships between macro factors and asset clusters** using DAGs. The pipeline supports intervention analysis and scenario-based allocation (e.g., shocks to rates, inflation, volatility).  
- Techniques: DAG, Causal Discovery, Double Machine Learning, Intervention Analysis, Portfolio Optimization  
- Keywords: Causal Inference, Asset Allocation, Macro Factors, Explainable Allocation

### Posterior-NCO  
**Improving NCO Portfolio Allocation via Posterior Covariance and Bayesian Updating**  
- Role: Leader / Researcher / Engineer  
- Summary:  
  An extension of Nested Clustered Optimization (NCO) that replaces sample covariance with **posterior covariance** estimated via Bayesian updating. The framework integrates manager views and uncertainty to improve out-of-sample stability.  
- Techniques: NCO, Bayesian Updating, Monte Carlo Backtesting, Portfolio Optimization  
- Keywords: Portfolio Construction, Robust Covariance, Bayesian Finance

### Causal Factor GAN  
**The Dawn of Explainable Quantitative Finance**  
- Role: Leader / ML Engineer  
- Summary:  
  A causal data generating process (DGP) combined with GANs to simulate factor-driven return dynamics under **intervention and counterfactual scenarios**. Enables stress-testing factor portfolios beyond correlation-based simulations.  
- Techniques: DAG-based Causal Modeling, Conditional GAN, QuantGAN, Time Series Generation  
- Keywords: Causal Inference, GAN, Factor Investing, Synthetic Data

### AFML Code Implementation  
**Reproducible Implementations of Methods from _Advances in Financial Machine Learning_**  
- Role: Contributor / Engineer  
- Summary:  
  A clean, modular Python implementation of core methodologies from Marcos López de Prado’s *Advances in Financial Machine Learning*, including event-driven labeling, purged k-fold CV, meta-labeling, sample weighting, and fractional differentiation.  
- Techniques: Triple Barrier Labeling, Purged K-Fold CV, Meta-Labeling, Sample Weights, Fractional Differentiation  
- Keywords: Financial Machine Learning, Reproducibility, Backtesting Infrastructure

### BOBP ETF Listing & Management  
**Design, Launch, and Ongoing Management of a Rules-Based ETF**  
- Role: Product Lead / Quant Researcher  
- Summary:  
  End-to-end design of the BOBP ETF, including index construction, portfolio rules, rebalancing logic, and live monitoring. Focused on building a transparent, rules-based ETF with robust backtesting and risk controls.  
- Techniques: Index Construction, Portfolio Rules, Rebalancing, Risk Management, Live Monitoring  
- Keywords: ETF Design, Asset Management, Index Methodology, Portfolio Operations

### GDP Nowcasting with Explainable Machine Learning  
- Role: ML Engineer  
- Summary:  
  High-frequency macro nowcasting framework using financial and textual indicators. Model explainability is emphasized via SHAP and feature attribution to interpret economic drivers of GDP revisions.  
- Techniques: XGBoost, SHAP, Macro Indicators, Text-based Features  
- Keywords: Nowcasting, Explainable AI, Macroeconomics

### Synthetic Data Backtesting Framework  
- Role: ML Engineer  
- Summary:  
  A backtesting framework using **synthetic return paths** generated by statistical and GAN-based models to evaluate robustness under distribution shifts.  
- Techniques: Time Series GAN, Monte Carlo Simulation, Robust Backtesting  
- Keywords: Backtesting, Synthetic Data, Model Robustness
